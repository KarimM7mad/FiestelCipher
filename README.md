# FiestelCipher
a C++ Implementaion of a Fiestel type symetric block cipher with constraints as follow: 
1. The cipher should be 8 rounds 
2. The block size is 64 bits 
3. The key size is also 64 bits 
4. The core function should treat the block as a string of bytes (8 bits each unit) 
5. The cipher should be as effecient as possible.
