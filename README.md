# fiestelCipher
It is required to build a Fiestel type symetric block cipher 1. The cipher should be 8 rounds 2. The block size is 64 bits 3. The key size is also 64 bits 4. The core function should treat the block as a string of bytes (8 bits each unit) 5. The cipher should be as effecient as possible. 6. You should be able to encryption and decrypt a file
